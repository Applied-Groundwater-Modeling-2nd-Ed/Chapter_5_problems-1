Anderson Woessner and Hunt (2015) book problems 

This repository is for teaching materials for Chapter 5 of Anderson Woessner and Hunt (2015).  

The teaching material is designed to form one resource for an open-source teaching environment that facilitates a high quality groundwater and environmental modeling community into the future. This software, documentation, and example data sets are made available by the authors and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to be used in the public interest and in the advancement of science. The performance of teaching materials has been tested in a variety of applications. Future applications, however, might reveal errors that were not detected in the test simulations. Users are requested to notify rjhunt@facstaff.wisc.edu if any errors are found in this material. Updates might occasionally be made to this material and the underlying software; users are encouraged to check the website periodically.
